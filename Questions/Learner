âœ… Problem Statement: Learning Application â€“ Learners & Enrolled Courses
A learning application maintains a list of registered learners and their enrolled courses.

You must complete a program that:

Maintains a list of learners and their enrolled courses

Implements operations based on the learner's course status

ðŸ§¾ Class Definitions
ðŸ”¹ Course class â€“ Attributes:
String courseId

String courseName

String status â†’ Can be either "Inprogress" or "Completed"

int duration â†’ Duration in hours

âœ… You must implement:

Getters and setters for all fields

Parameterized constructor

ðŸ”¹ Learner class â€“ Attributes:
String learnerId

String learnerName

List<Course> courses

âœ… You must implement:

Getters and setters

Parameterized constructor

ðŸ“˜ LearnerSolution class:
Create a class that holds the logic with two static methods:

âœ… Static Methods to Implement
1. FindOngoingCourseCount(List<Learner> learners, String learnerId)
This method should:

Count how many "Inprogress" courses are enrolled by the given learnerId.

If learnerId is not valid or if no such courses exist:

yaml
Copy
Edit
No ongoing courses
2. FindTotalLearningHours(List<Learner> learners, String learnerId)
This method should:

Print the total learning hours (sum of duration) of all "Completed" courses for the given learner.

If learnerId is invalid or no "Completed" courses exist:

arduino
Copy
Edit
No completed courses available
ðŸ“Œ Notes:
Learner ID always starts with "L0.."

Course ID always starts with "C0.."

ðŸ§ª Input Format:
First line: Number of learners

For each learner:

Learner ID

Learner name

Number of enrolled courses

For each course:

Course ID

Course name

Course status (Inprogress or Completed)

Duration (int)

Final line: learnerId to check (used in both methods)
