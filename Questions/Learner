✅ Question 1: Learning App – Learner & Course
🧠 Problem Statement:
You need to build a system that manages:

A list of registered learners

Their enrolled courses

📦 Class 1: Learner
Attributes:

String learnerId

String learnerName

List<Course> courses

➡️ Implement:

Getters and setters for all fields

Parameterized constructor

📦 Class 2: Course
Attributes:

String courseId

String courseName

String status (only values: "Inprogress" or "Completed")

int duration (in hours)

➡️ Implement:

Getters and setters

Parameterized constructor

📘 Class: LearnerSolution
You must create 2 static methods:

🔹 Method 1: FindOngoingCourseCount
Inputs:

List<Learner> learners

String learnerId

Output:

Count of courses that are in "Inprogress" status for the given learner

If no such learner or no such course exists, print:

yaml
Copy
Edit
No ongoing courses
🔹 Method 2: FindTotalLearningHours
Inputs:

List<Learner> learners

String learnerId

Output:

Sum of duration of all "Completed" courses for that learner

If none found or learner ID is invalid, print:

arduino
Copy
Edit
No completed courses available
🔸 Note:
Learner ID starts with L0..

Course ID starts with C0..
